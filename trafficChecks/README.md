### Question

You are given a log that contains the health checks for different service your company is running.

```
Service Cell QPS Throughput(Mbps)
service-a 123 20000 200
service-a 124 24300 240
service-a 125 31000 330
service-b 122 20043 120
service-b 123 34500 170
service-c 124 23420 300
service-c 125 43200 550
service-c 126 23204 320
service-c 127 30200 360
```

Assume those are all services running currently.
Please output the info the QPS and Throughput per cell, and then per service
